# Malware Analysis
In this section I want to explain the methods I use to analyze malware (I'm a beginner now, but I'm trying to improve my analysis skills :) ), and introduce the resources to get started in this beautiful topic in hacking world.

## How to get started in Malware Analysis
### Books
* [Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting/dp/1593272901) (I am reading it now, a teacher recommended this book to me first)
* [Rootkits and Bootkits: Reversing Modern Malware and Next Generation Threats](https://www.amazon.com/Rootkits-Bootkits-Reversing-Malware-Generation/dp/1593277164/ref=sr_1_2?crid=CSJVUBG77S12&keywords=rootkit&qid=1643229576&s=books&sprefix=rootkit%2Cstripbooks%2C185&sr=1-2) (I haven't read it yet, but the malware analysis community recommends this book)

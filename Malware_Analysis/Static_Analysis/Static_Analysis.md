# Static Analysis

Static Analysis is the process of analyzing the code or structure of a program/malware/software to find out what its functionality is, in short, we only look at the bytes inside the program, all the information that the program reveals without running it. In this section we will see:
  - Steps to do a static analysis.
  - Malware obfuscated and packaged.
  - The PE file format.
  - Common libraries for malware on Windows.
  - Headers of a PE file.
  - Some Interesting Tools.

## Steps to do a static analysis
  1. Scan for "malware" in various antiviruses, it is highly recommendeded to use the [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) website to scan software that you suspect to be malware (I recommend using the hash of the program, as I explain in the next point).
  2. Use the hash of the program (If you don't know what is a hash, read this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) article), in malware analysis it is common to use the MD5 hash, which is not recommended to protect passwords or general data, but when it comes to malware, it is useful way to share information with others without giving the actual executable file. To get the hash of a program there are many tools you can use, as I describe below...
      - To get the MD5 hash on Windows you can use tools like [WinMD5](https://www.winmd5.com/), [Sigcheck](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sigcheck) from the Sysinternals tool kit (If you don't know about Sysinternals, do some research on the web or wait for me to write about it :P) or you can use the powershell utility [Get-FileHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7.2).
   
      - With the file hash, you can use it to search on the web for this hash, share it with other malware analysts, use it as a Indicator of Compromise (IoC) and you can use it on the VirusTotal webpage (mentionened above) to do analysis, and do not provide the file itself, that is a better way when you don't know if the malware if a generic malware or a dedicated malware.
